                        <b>Faster and more efficient.</b> Refactored the entire codebase with better
                        approaches. The application now will take up less space on the hard drive
                        and use fewer resources. Some visuals were also improved.

                        <b>Better framework.</b> Use of a totally different approach to building the
                        app. Updated a lot of important dependencies after almost a year. These
                        updates will make the app more faster and secure.

                        has what it needs to be a good screen-recording application. I will continue
                        to support this project to improve stability and fix vulnerabilities, but no
                        new features will be added.

                        recorded video will be ready. This beautiful toast message will show you
                        progress on your recorded video.

                        and other multimedia files and streams. What does it mean for Lucast? Now
                        you have a wide variety of formats to choose from, you can set a resolution
                        that differs from your native, you can customize your recorder video frame
                        rate, and you can configure the volume of your audio! Whatever you choose,
                        the quality of the output video will be so much better than in v1.3.0!
                        High-quality video and clear audio with small file size, that is what it
                        means!

                        directory to open it with your explorer. Also &quot;information&quot; and
                        &quot;settings&quot; buttons are there, as well as the new information about
                        your disk usage, so you can keep track of how many videos you can record

                        remember, the most optional is the one with your screen resolution! Higher
                        bitrate - higher image quality and bigger file size, lower quality - smaller
